# Calibre RSS Journal

In addition to PDF, many research journal articles are made available as HTML files on journal websites. Reading these on e-readers is currently hampered by the way the original html is set up.

This currently parses a set of URL's in a single text file hosted on the web (use the "dl." link for dropbox).

Currently can handle BMC Journals (tested on BMC Bioinformatics and BioData Mining) and Oxford Journals.

## Planned Improvements

Parse text that includes the title:link

Handle other journals (Pubmed Central, PeerJ, eLife, PNAS, CSHL, Nature, Science, Wiley)

Remove the extra fluff on the HTML page that isn't actually part of the article
