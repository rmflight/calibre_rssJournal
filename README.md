# Calibre RSS Journal

In addition to PDF, many research journal articles are made available as HTML files on journal websites. Reading these on e-readers is currently hampered by the way the original html is set up.

This currently parses a set of URL's in a single text file hosted on the web (use the "dl." link for dropbox).

An example file for examination and testing is provide [here](http://rmflight.github.io/calibre_rssJournal/testJournals.txt)

## Currently Supported

PLOS

Oxford Journals

BMC Journals

PNAS (note that a subscription will be required to test the recipe with the urls on the example page)

## Planned Improvements

Handle other journals (Pubmed Central (this might be through download of the epub versions that PMC is making available), PeerJ, eLife, PNAS, CSHL, Nature, Science, Wiley)

Remove the extra fluff on the HTML page that isn't actually part of the article
