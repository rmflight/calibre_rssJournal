# Calibre RSS Journal

In addition to PDF, many research journal articles are made available as HTML files on journal websites. Reading these on e-readers is currently hampered by the way the original html is set up.

This is my attempt to build Calibre RSS feed processing *recipes* that can properly process an RSS feed from a journal article, and then be converted to an epub for viewing on an e-reader.

Because my interests are in Bioinformatics, I will be concentrating on the journals *Bioinformatics* and *BMC Bioinformatics* to start. I would appreciate comments and thoughts.

## Dev environment

I have setup a virtual machine with a source install of Calibre to make the Calibre modules available to the iPython Notebook that I am using to actually develop the recipes. Suggestions are welcome.
