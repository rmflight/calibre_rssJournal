<a href="article_0/index.html" class="article">Extra-binomial variation approach for analysis of pooled DNA sequencing data</a><span class="articledate"> [Sat, 10 Nov 08:28]</span><div class="articledescription">Motivation: The invention of next-generation sequencing technology has made it possible to study the rare variants that are more likely to pinpoint causal disease genes. To make such experiments financially viable, DNA samples from several subjects are often pooled before sequencing. This induces large between-pool variation which, together with other sources of experimental error, creates over-dispersed data. Statistical analysis of pooled sequencing data needs to appropriately model this additi…</div>

<a href="article_1/index.html" class="article">Application and evaluation of automated methods to extract neuroanatomical connectivity statements from free text</a><span class="articledate"> [Sat, 10 Nov 08:28]</span><div class="articledescription">Motivation: Automated annotation of neuroanatomical connectivity statements from the neuroscience literature would enable accessible and large-scale connectivity resources. Unfortunately, the connectivity findings are not formally encoded and occur as natural language text. This hinders aggregation, indexing, searching and integration of the reports. We annotated a set of 1377 abstracts for connectivity relations to facilitate automated extraction of connectivity relationships from neuroscience l…</div>
